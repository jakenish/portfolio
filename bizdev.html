            <p id="biz_about">The vast majority of my business development work is through my involvement in the creation of the Eye In The Sky web platform. This digital product provides independent musicians with e-commerce solutions to sell music and merch and connects the revenue generated from these custom stores to a network of vetted label services.</p>
            <p id="role">In the buildup to launching the MVP, I assisted in the market research, created the pro forma financial documents, updated the investor and marketing decks, implemented a new CRM system, and participated in investor outreach. In addition, I've been involved with much of the actual design of the product, along with the CEO and development team.</p>

            <p id="research_about">Using various sources, I determined both the size of our potential customer base, and also where our customers are located geographically. Though it is difficult to know exactly how many independent musicians there are, I was able to show that the market for our product is large enough for our platform to profitably scale.</p>

            <p id="financials_about">In order to determine the viability of the platform and attract investors, I was tasked with creating our pro forma financials from scratch. For obvious reasons, they cannot be displayed here. The picture above shows the income statement for a hypothetical company I created for school. However, this document was generated based on the format I used for the EITS document. </p>
