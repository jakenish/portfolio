            <p id="band_about">I've worked on a variety of band projects in a variety of capacities. In general, I work closely with bands on all aspects of their record release cycles. I have created marketing plans, assisted in assembling support teams (PR, distributor, graffic designer, etc.), created master schedules for content releases, assisted in content creation (including the production of music videos), and met regularly with bands to discuss all aspects of their projects. I've also branded national tours, as well as created and managed social media contests.</p>

            <p id="float_about">I was involved with all aspects of marketing for this first year music festival. I developed the overall marketing plan, tracked all social and web analytics, created and orchestrated digital and event driven contests and promotions, served as community manager on all social accounts, analyzed sales trends, and coordinated with partner vendors on all major marketing pushes. I also played an integral part in developing the overall brand of the festival.</p>
